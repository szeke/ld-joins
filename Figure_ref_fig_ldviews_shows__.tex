Figure~\ref{fig:ldviews} shows a subset of the ontology for the human trafficking domain: the ovals represent classes, the solid lines represent object properties and the dotted lines represent datatype properties.
The class Offer represents an offer for an item, and includes information about the place where the offer is available, the price, availability date, and a link to a description of the item provided.
In the human trafficking domain the item provided is an adult service, and it is described using the physical characteristics extracted from the advertisement. 
Offers also link to sellers, who are identified using a phone number and email address.
In many situations the seller and the adult service are the same person, and sometimes the seller is a trafficker and the adult service is the victim.
Investigators want to identify these two cases, but it is difficult to do so traffickers work very hard to conceal their identity.

The graph captures the important distinctions in the domain and enables a varied arrange of investigative queries.
For example, it is possible to find all places associated with a phone number by following the paths from phones to sellers to offers and to places.
It is also possible to identify the web sites where the same adult service is advertised.
These lines of inquiry require powerful query capabilities to perform a varied collection of join and aggregation operations.
