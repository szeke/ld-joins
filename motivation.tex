\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Many Linked Data applications are web portals that offer users query and visualization of RDF datasets constructed by integrating multiple data sources and mapping them to a domain model defined by one or several ontologies.

These applications use massive RDF datasets containing 100s of millions of RDF triples and require interactive query response.


The main motivation for our work on \ldviews is to facilitate construction of interactive web portals that offer users keyword and structured search, faceted browsing and rich visualization over massive datasets with fast response times.
