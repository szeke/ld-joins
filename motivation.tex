\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
The main motivation for our work on \ldviews is desire to build interactive web portals that offer users keyword and structured search, faceted browsing and visualization over massive datasets with fast response times:  under 1 second to give users the feeling that they are navigating the data, and under 10 seconds for more complex operations such as the creation of visualizations \cite{nielsen1994usability}.
