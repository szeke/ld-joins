Many Linked Data applications are web portals that offer users query and visualization of RDF datasets constructed by integrating multiple data sources and mapping them to a domain model defined by one or several ontologies.
Notable examples include Open PHACTS \cite{Groth_Loizou_Gray_Goble_Harland_Pettifer_2014}, Bio2RDF \cite{callahan2013bio2rdf} and DIG \cite{szekely2015building}.
These applications use massive RDF datasets containing 100s of millions of RDF triples and require interactive query response.
