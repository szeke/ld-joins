\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
The main motivation for our work on \ldviews is desire to build interactive web portals that offer users keyword and structured search, faceted browsing and visualization over massive datasets with fast response times:  under 1 second to give users the feeling that they are navigating the data, and under 10 seconds for more complex operations such as the creation of visualizations \cite{nielsen1994usability}.

Many Linked Data applications are web portals that offer users query and visualization of RDF datasets constructed by integrating multiple data sources and mapping them to a domain model defined by one or several ontologies.
Notable examples include Open PHACTS \cite{Groth_Loizou_Gray_Goble_Harland_Pettifer_2014}, Bio2RDF \cite{callahan2013bio2rdf} and DIG \cite{szekely2015building}.
These applications use massive RDF datasets containing 100s of millions of RDF triples and require interactive query response.
