\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
The main motivation for our work is the construction of domain-specific knowledge graphs to enable users to do detailed, in-depth investigations in their particular domain.
For example, in the human trafficking domain, the knowledge graph is constructed from extractions from 76 million web pages with classified ads and reviews of escort services.
Law enforcement officers investigate possible trafficking cases by following leads using all the pieces of information they have, such as phone numbers, locations, names, physical descriptions.
Investigators need to identify victims across classified ads posted on multiple web sites and multiple cities, and they need analyze correlations among possible victims such as similar pattern of travel in order to build cases against traffickers.
