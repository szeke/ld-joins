Figure \ref{fig:ui} presents parts of the user interface that investigators use to query the human trafficking knowledge graph and to visualize the results.
The user interface uses the keyword and faceted search interface paradigm to enable investigators to search for any terms that may appear in an escort advertisement, and to filter based on attributes of the data (Figure~\ref{fid:ldviews}.
Users may search for instances of the main classes in the ontology (WebPage, AdultService, Phone, etc.) and may filter based on any attribute connected via property paths to the selected class (e.g., filter Phone using the localities via the owner/availableAt/locality path).
