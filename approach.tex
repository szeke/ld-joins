% 5 pages
inputs / outputs

\begin{verbatim}
% input is n triples aligned to a certain vocabulary
% output is json-ld documents structured to support optimized query in ES/document store
% needs a worked example, of why we need nested queries.  pages / offers / phone number
% list six types: offers, phone numbers, pages, etc.
% need to explain when we facet, for example if we facet by phone on phones, you only get one phone.
% the json ld documents generated a denormalize according to how deeply you need to go to support your queries.

% a. explain where we start from. 
% b. data alignment karma/r2rml/sparql construct 
% c. join precompute rdf -> serialize to json-ld -> frame using spark
% d. indexing documents
% describe the operations we need to perform over the doucments
