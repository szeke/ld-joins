We propose \ldviews, an approach that enables data providers to define views on an RDF graph as directed acyclic graphs that can be materialized and indexed to support efficient queries and address these challenges.
Our approach uses the JSON-LD serialization of RDF \cite{Lanthaler:2012:UJC:2307819.2307827} to materialize the views as documents, indexes them in a NoSQL store, and enables clients to query the RDF using the native query language of the NoSQL store.

The approach provides significantly richer access to the graph than traditional parameterized SPARQL queries exposed as Web APIs, superior performance compared to equivalent SPARQL queries on the original graph, and high availability through replication. 

We present a motivating example for our approach in section~\ref{sec:motivation}.
We present details of our approach in section~\ref{sec:approach}, including the specification of views, the algorithm for efficiently materializing them, and the approach to indexing the data in ElasticSearch, the NoSQL store we use in our implementation.
We evaluate our approach in section~\ref{sec:evaluation}, describing a new benchmark for evaluating query performance for web portal applications. 
Our evaluation shows that our approach vastly outperforms SPARQL, enabling sub second response times in a large web portal compared to 10 or even 100s of seconds in SPARQL.
We compare our work with other approaches in section~\ref{sec:related-work} and close with a discussion of the results and directions for future work in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
