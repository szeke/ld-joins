  abstractnote = {The combination of the flexibility of RDF and the expressiveness of SPARQL provides a powerful mechanism to model, integrate and query data. However, these properties also mean that it is nontrivial to write performant SPARQL queries. Indeed, it is quite easy to create queries that tax even the most optimised triple stores. Currently, application developers have little concrete guidance on how to write “good” queries. The goal of this paper is to begin to bridge this gap. It describes 5 heuristics that can be applied to create optimised queries. The heuristics are informed by formal results in the literature on the semantics and complexity of evaluating SPARQL queries, which ensures that queries following these rules can be optimised effectively by an underlying RDF store. Moreover, we empirically verify the efficacy of the heuristics using a set of openly available datasets and corresponding SPARQL queries developed by a large pharmacology data integration project. The experimental results show improvements in performance across 6 state-of-the-art RDF stores.},

  abstractnote = {Effcient RDF data management is an essential factor in realizing the Semantic Web vision. However, most existing RDF storage schemes based on row-store relational databases are constrained in terms of efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose an RDF storage scheme that implements sextuple indexing for RDF triples using a column-oriented DBMS. To evaluate the performance of our approach, large-scale datasets upto 13 million triples are generated and benchmark queries that cover important RDF join patterns are devised. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the row-oriented DBMS approach by upto an order of magnitude and is even competitive to the best state-of-the-art native RDF store.},

  abstractnote = {Data integration is a key challenge faced in pharmacology where there are numerous heterogeneous databases spanning multiple domains (e.g. chemistry and biology). To address this challenge, the Open PHACTS consortium has developed the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform that leverages Linked Data to provide integrated access to pharmacology databases. Between its launch in April 2013 and March 2014, the platform has been accessed over 13.5 million times and has multiple applications that integrate with it. In this work, we discuss how Application Programming Interfaces can extend the classical Linked Data Application Architecture to facilitate data integration. Additionally, we show how the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform implements this extended architecture.},
