% explain that elasticsearch is one way to support these queries
% we need to map queries to elasticsearch
% a. time to preprocess (sparql none / ld fragments a little / ld joins a lot
% b. time to load (sparql some / ld fragments none / ld joins some
% c. time to execute queries (sparql lots / ld fragments infinity / ld joins litte )
% d. benchmark explanation

% intuition
% how long does it take to do a keyword search
% how long does it take to facet
% how long does it take to assemble an entity
% how long does it take display results using a visualization
% for virtuoso queries, we need to parallelize 
% the driver should generate the sparql queries and write them to a file
% we can report the results two ways.  queries just create the facets or queries return actual nested entities.
% need to figure out how to reconstruct the json-ld from the sparql results
