\section{Introduction}
SPARQL, the standard query language for RDF graphs is also the de-facto standard for building applications that consume Linked Data. 
Despite substantial research on optimizing SPARQL query processing \cite{Pham2013}, the computation of query solutions remains a computationally intensive task for large datasets.
As a result, it becomes challenging for maintainers of SPARQL endpoints to guarantee high availability.
For example, a recent survey \cite{buil2013sparql} revealed that less than half of the public endpoints reach an availability of 95\%.
The computational cost of SPARQL query answering also makes it challenging for application developers to build high performance applications serving large numbers of users.
Application developers often spend a substantial amount of time optimizing queries to support interactive applications \cite{Loizou_Angles_Groth_2014}.
