\section{Introduction}
SPARQL, the standard query language for RDF graphs is also the de-facto standard for building applications that consume Linked Data. 
Despite substantial research on optimizing SPARQL query processing \cite{Pham2013}, the computation of query solutions remains a computationally intensive task for datasets with hundreds of millions of RDF triples.
As a result, it becomes challenging for maintainers of public SPARQL endpoints to guarantee high availability.
For example, recent survey \cite{buil2013sparql}revealed that less than half of the public endpoints reach an availability of 95%.
The computational cost of SPRQL query answering also makes it challenging for application developers to build high performance applications serving large numbers of users.
