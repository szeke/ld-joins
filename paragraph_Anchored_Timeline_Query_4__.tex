\paragraph{(Anchored) Timeline Query (4):} retrieve the number of instances of a class grouped according to a date attribute reachable via property path associated with a class.
A timeline query is anchored when restricted to only the instances associated with a particular entity called the anchor.
The following example illustrates an anchored query to compute the timeline of offers associated with a phone\footnote{The listed query is a simplified version for illustration purposes; the correct query must group for weeks across years.}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ui}.
\begin{quote}
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
select count(?offer)
   PHONE owner/offer ?offer .
   ?offer a Offer ; startDate ?date .
group by week(?date)
\end{verbatim}}
\end{quote}
