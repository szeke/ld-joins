\paragraph{(Anchored) Facet Query (2):} retrieve the distinct values and the count of each value for a property path associated with a class.
The following example illustrates the query to populate the \verb|CITY| facet in Figure \ref{fig:ui}.
The anchored version of the query includes an additional clause such as the \verb|PHONE| clause to restrict the query to values related to a particular entity:
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
select distinct ?locality count(?webpage)
   ?webpage a WebPage ;
       mainEntity/availableAt/locality ?locality . PHONE owner/offer/mainEntityOfPage ?webpage .
group by ?locality
\end{verbatim}}
