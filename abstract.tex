% abstract from pedro's email reproposing paper
Scalability and efficient query answering are key challenges for RDF stores.
Web portals like amazon.com providing keyword search, faceted browsing and analytic results are an important class of applications that require sub-second query response on very large datasets.
We present an analysis of the query requirements of these applications, a query benchmark based on a deployed application, and an approach to store RDF graphs in document-oriented NoSQL stores to support these applications.
Our evaluations show that a NoSQL store outperforms a triple store by a factor of XXX.
