% abstract from pedro's email reproposing paper
Scalability and efficient query answering are key challenges for RDF stores.
Web sites such as amazon.com, which provide keyword search, faceted browsing and analytic results, are an important class of applications that require sub-second query response on very large datasets.
We present LD-VIEWS, an approach based on JSON-LD to define views of RDF graphs for these applications to support thousands of queries per second in NoSQL stores.
%Our evaluations show that a NoSQL store outperforms a triple store by a factors between 10 and 1,000 in a benchmark for this class of applications.

%analysis of the query requirements of this class of applications, a query benchmark based on a deployed application, 
Our evaluations show that LD-VIEWS outperforms SPARQL on response time by a factor of 10 in a single node and by a factor of 100 on a cluster and supports 100 times more simultaneous users.
